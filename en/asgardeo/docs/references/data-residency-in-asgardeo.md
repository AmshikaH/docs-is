### Administrator data

Users onboarded to Asgardeo as [organization administrators]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-administrators/) are granted access to the global WSO2 services such as billing and support. Therefore, the administrator data (including profile information and login information from the billing/support portals) was previously stored exclusively in the US datacenter.

The profile information of organization administrators includes all the data that organization administrators enter in their user profiles.

### End-user data

Data of your end users are only stored in the regional datacenter you selected when onboarding to Asgardeo.

## Data sharing

Some of your data, such as logs, will be accessible outside your selected region to ensure that WSO2's global entities (currently includes the USA, Sri Lanka, and Brazil) can provide technical support and other services. For example, technical support teams outside the region will need access to this data for various support and troubleshooting purposes. However, this data is stored only in the regional
datacenter that you have selected.

Therefore, note that your organizationâ€“level logs may include personal information (such as the IP addresses and email addresses) of your end users.
